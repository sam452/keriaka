Feature: SMS User view most recent prices
  As a farmer, I want to see the most recent prices for maize on my cell.

  Scenario:
    Given the following Commodity:
      | name  | maize |
      | description | yellow |
      
    And that commodity has the following prices:
      | price | quality | buyer |
      | 10    | good    | Joe   |
      | 11    | good    | Joe   |
      | 12    | good    | Joe   |
      | 13    | good    | Joe   |
      | 14    | good    | Joe   |
      | 15    | good    | Joe   |

   Given I send a GET request for "/responses/show" with the following:
    { "FromCity": "Nashville", "body": "corn" }
    
    Then the response should be "200"
    And the response JSON should be:
      """
      [{ "FromCity": "Nashville", "body": "corn" }]
      """
